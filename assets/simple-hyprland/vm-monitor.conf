# VM Monitor Configuration for Simple Hyprland
# Optimized for VMware Fusion and other VM environments
# Based on auto-detection from vm-scale.sh

# VMware Fusion optimized configuration
# Use 1920x1080 with 1.25x scaling for optimal readability
monitor=,1920x1080@60,auto,1.25

# VM-specific environment variables for better compatibility
env = WLR_NO_HARDWARE_CURSORS,1
env = WLR_RENDERER_ALLOW_SOFTWARE,1

# Additional VM optimizations
# These help with rendering stability in virtualized environments
